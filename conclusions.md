Conclusiones

Developing the project wasn't easy, most of the team was new to the technologies needed to implement the ideas we had in mind. The first challenge we faced was learning and then getting used to the tools and frameworks. Then, once we had a basic understanding on how to do the front end, we had to implement backend, thankfully, José had previous experience with it and could guide us throughout the development of our website. Once we had the basis of our website fully operational, we worked on making it prettier and implementing new features. For the front end, we changed to react and instead of using bootstrap, we used tailwind, this gave us more liberty at the time of styling our website but also added another level of complexity. We then implemented better graphs, secure passwords, profile pictures, error pop up messages, translation and unit conversion. This last stage was the most difficult one, but at the same time the most rewarding one.

Personal Section:

Emiliano Hinojosa: Personally, the project was very challenging but at the same time very rewarding. To first have an idea and then see it come to life was a great experience. I learned a lot since I wasn't familiar with most of the technologies we used for the project. I was in charge of developing the nav-bar. the home page and the initial design for the profile settings tab.
